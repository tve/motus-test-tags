Motus CTT test tag
==================

**WARNING: the code here "works" but is not ready for prime time**

This code uses Arduino RadioLib to program a common integrated FSK radio transceiver to act as a
CTT test tag @434Mhz.

Boards supported:
- Adafruit Feather 32u4 RFM69HCW (product ID 3077)
- Possibly: Adafruit Feather M0 RFM69HCW (product ID 3177)

 Be sure to use the 433Mhz version of these boards, not the 915Mhz one, although it's likely to
 work too...
